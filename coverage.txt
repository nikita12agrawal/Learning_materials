use gcov as tool to find coverage


need to add -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage in CFLAGS while compiling using gcc.

this will generate gcno files

after succesfull termination of program, gcda and gcov files are generated 
with the help of which coverage of each files can be find out using this command:

gcov file_name.gcno 
or
gcov file_name.c
